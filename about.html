            <h1>About Derek's Computer System</h1>
            <p>A remarkable about page is genuine, approachable,
               and distinguished. Visitors should get a glimpse into
                what working with you might be like. You can include personal
                 interests, stories, and photos that convey the unique story of your business. You may also
               include information about who’s on your team and what their roles are.</p>
               <p>Your about page can and will be more comprehensive than a single mission statement.
                 However, to draw people in, you need to succinctly state your goal in the industry
                  up front.
                What is your business here to do? Why should your website visitors care? This information
                 will give the reader something to remember
                 about your company long after they leave your website.</p>
                 <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                 <p>You want as many eyeballs on your about page as possible. However, you won’t do 
                  business with every single website visitor. That’s why you must identify and mention your core customer.
                  Your about page should explain the exact people your business helps. This allows prospects
                   to know if your service aligns with their needs.</p>
                   <p>Got some loyal customers in your portfolio? Use your about page to tell the world about them.
                     Consider naming your most successful clients and linking
                     to a case study.</p>
                     <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                     <p>Sometimes, businesses are afraid that in-depth explanations of their products
                       aren’t interesting enough or will sound unappealing in writing. That’s a fair concern.
                        Start by explaining
                       what problem your offering solves. Then, link to a page with more information.</p>

                      <h1>Our Career</h1>
                      <p>Got some loyal customers in your portfolio? 
                        Use your about page to tell the world about them.
                         Consider naming your most successful clients and linking to a case study.

                        Case studies can influence your prospects’ purchasing decisions
                         since they show your company’s past successes. Plus, they help prospects
                          to envision their future success through the stories of your best customers.</p>
